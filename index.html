                    <p>I am a former teacher with a degree in Biology. After spending several years in the classroom
                        I've moved into higher ed and educational outreach. I work with about 4 
                        schools in the area and also lead a team of undergraduate student workers
                        Our goal is to inspire youth to have a lifelong curiosity for the world
                        and interest in the sciences. We hope that students from all backgrounds
                        see themselves as scientists and scholars after their time with us.
